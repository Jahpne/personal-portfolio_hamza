# Personal-Portfolio
I meticulously crafted this portfolio using a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Django,
while harnessing the power of MySQL for the database. One of the distinguishing features of this 
portfolio is its dynamic nature, allowing for effortless content management through the admin interface. 
Additionally, I have thoughtfully incorporated all pertinent personal information, ensuring that this 
website serves as a comprehensive representation of my professional journey and capabilities.
